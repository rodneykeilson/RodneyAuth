## üéÆ Project Demo

### How to Use
1. Install dependencies and run migrations (see Installation). The seed script provisions admin, manager, and member accounts.
2. Start the development server with `npm run dev` (defaults to http://localhost:9002).
3. Sign in using the seeded admin account to access the dashboard.
4. Navigate to `/admin/users` to assign roles, toggle two-factor requirement, or reset passwords for any user.
5. Registration flow supports optional authenticator setup; users can skip it and enable 2FA later.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Role Management**: Admin-only console to promote/demote users between `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, and `MEMBER` roles.
- **Optional Two-Factor**: Users may enroll an authenticator app during or after registration; admins can require 2FA per user.
- **Password & Session Control**: Secure hashing with bcryptjs and Prisma-backed session storage via HTTP-only cookies.
- **Admin Password Reset**: Admins can issue password resets directly from the user directory.
- **Protected Routing**: Middleware and server-side checks guard dashboard and admin routes.
